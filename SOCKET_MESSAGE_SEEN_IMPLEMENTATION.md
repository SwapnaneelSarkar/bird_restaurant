# Socket Message Seen Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of real-time message seen functionality using Socket.IO as requested by Mohit Mishra.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Socket Events Added

#### Receiver Side (when "receive_message" is emitted)
When a message is received via the `receive_message` socket event, the app now automatically emits:
```javascript
socket.emit('message_seen', {
  'roomId': roomId,
  'messageId': messageId,
  'seenBy': userId,
});
```

#### Sender Side (listening for read confirmations)
The app now listens for the `message_seen` event:
```javascript
socket.on('message_seen', (data) {
  print('Message seen event received: $data');
  String messageId = data['messageId'];
  String readBy = data['seenBy'];
  String readAt = data['seenAt'];
});
```

### 2. Files Modified

#### `lib/services/chat_services.dart`
- Added `_handleMessageSeen()` method to handle incoming message seen events
- Added `emitMessageSeen()` method to emit message seen events
- Updated `_handleReceivedMessage()` to automatically emit message_seen when messages are received
- Added socket event listener for `message_seen` events

#### `lib/presentation/screens/chat/event.dart`
- Added `MarkMessageAsSeen` event for marking individual messages as seen

#### `lib/presentation/screens/chat/bloc.dart`
- Added `_onMarkMessageAsSeen()` event handler
- Registered the new event handler in the constructor

#### `lib/presentation/screens/chat/view.dart`
- Added `_markMessageAsSeen()` method
- Updated `_buildMessageBubble()` to automatically mark messages as seen when displayed
- Messages are marked as seen when they appear in the UI

### 3. Key Features

#### Automatic Message Seen
- When a message is received via socket, it's automatically marked as seen
- When a message is displayed in the UI, it's marked as seen
- Real-time read status updates via socket events

#### Manual Message Seen
- Individual messages can be marked as seen manually
- Room-wide mark as read functionality
- Hybrid approach: Socket.IO for real-time updates, REST API for persistence

#### Read Status Indicators
- Blue ticks for read messages
- Grey ticks for unread messages
- Real-time updates when messages are read by recipients

### 4. Usage Examples

#### Marking a specific message as seen:
```dart
// In chat bloc
chatBloc.add(MarkMessageAsSeen('message-id-123'));

// Direct service call
chatService.emitMessageSeen('message-id-123');
```

#### Marking all messages in a room as read:
```dart
// In chat bloc
chatBloc.add(MarkAsRead('room-id-123'));

// Direct service call
chatService.markAsRead('room-id-123');
```

### 5. Socket Event Flow

1. **Message Sent**: User sends a message via REST API + Socket.IO
2. **Message Received**: Recipient receives message via `receive_message` event
3. **Auto Mark as Seen**: Recipient automatically emits `message_seen` event
4. **Read Confirmation**: Sender receives `message_seen` event and updates UI
5. **Read Status Update**: Blue ticks appear for read messages

### 6. Error Handling

- Socket connection failures fall back to REST API
- Message seen events are debounced to prevent spam
- Connection health monitoring and automatic reconnection
- Graceful handling of missing message IDs or room IDs

### 7. Testing

A test file `lib/test/socket_chat_test.dart` has been created to test the socket functionality including:
- Connection testing
- Message sending
- Message seen events
- Read status updates

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Updates**: Instant read status updates via Socket.IO
2. **Reliable Delivery**: REST API fallback ensures message delivery
3. **User Experience**: Visual feedback with read receipts
4. **Performance**: Efficient socket-based communication
5. **Scalability**: Hybrid approach handles high load scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with the backend team
2. Monitor socket connection stability
3. Add analytics for message read rates
4. Consider adding typing indicators
5. Implement message delivery confirmations
