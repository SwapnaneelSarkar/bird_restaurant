# Audio File Setup Guide

## Current Error
The app is showing this error because the audio file is a placeholder text file, not an actual audio file:

```
❌ Error playing custom ringtone: PlatformException(AndroidAudioError, Failed to set source... MEDIA_ERROR_UNKNOWN {what:1}, MEDIA_ERROR_SYSTEM, null)
```

## How to Fix

### 1. Get a Real Audio File
You need to replace the placeholder file with an actual audio file:

**File to replace:** `assets/audio/notification_ringtone.ogg`

**Requirements:**
- Format: `.ogg` (preferred) or `.mp3`
- Duration: 10-15 seconds
- Size: Under 1MB
- Content: Should sound like an incoming phone call

### 2. Quick Solutions

#### Option A: Use a Free Ringtone
1. Download a free ringtone from websites like:
   - https://freesound.org/
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
   - https://www.zapsplat.com/

2. Convert to OGG format if needed (use online converters)

3. Replace the file: `assets/audio/notification_ringtone.ogg`

#### Option B: Create a Simple Test File
1. Use any short audio file (even 5 seconds)
2. Convert to OGG format
3. Replace the placeholder file

#### Option C: Use System Sound (Temporary)
If you don't have an audio file right now, the app will still work with just the system notification sound.

### 3. Test After Replacement

After replacing the file:

1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Test the notification

### 4. Expected Behavior

**With real audio file:**
- System notification sound (brief)
- Custom ringtone plays for 10-15 seconds
- Automatic stop after duration

**Without audio file:**
- System notification sound only
- No extended ringtone
- App continues to work normally

## Current Status

✅ **Error handling implemented** - App won't crash
✅ **Fallback mechanism** - Uses system sound if custom file is missing
✅ **Debug logs** - Shows what's happening

⚠️ **Need real audio file** - Replace the placeholder to enable custom ringtone

## File Location

```
your_app/
└── assets/
    └── audio/
        └── notification_ringtone.ogg  ← Replace this file
```

The error will be resolved once you replace the placeholder file with a real audio file!
