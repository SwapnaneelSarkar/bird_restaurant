# Edit Item Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 504 Gateway Timeout Error
- **Problem**: The update button was getting stuck and returning 504 errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Added 30-second timeout to HTTP requests
  - Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff (up to 2 retries)
  - Added specific error handling for network issues

### 2. API Request Body Mismatch
- **Problem**: The request body didn't match the API specification
- **Solution**: Updated the request body to match the API requirements:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Updated Breakfast Burrito",
    "price": 12.99,
    "category": "Breakfast",
    "description": "Updated delicious breakfast burrito",
    "isVeg": false,
    "isTaxIncluded": true,
    "isCancellable": true,
    "available": true,
    "timing_enabled": true,
    "timing_schedule": { ... },
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }
  ```

### 3. Unsupported Fields
- **Problem**: The UI was showing fields not supported by the API (like Food Type)
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed Food Type dropdown from the UI
  - Commented out unsupported field handling in the bloc
  - Focused on only the fields that the API actually supports

### 4. Validation Issues
- **Problem**: Poor validation before submission
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper validation for required fields
  - Added price validation (must be > 0)
  - Added trim() to remove whitespace from text inputs
  - Disabled submit button when form is invalid

### 5. Error Handling
- **Problem**: Generic error messages
- **Solution**:
  - Added specific error messages for different HTTP status codes
  - Added retry mechanism for network issues
  - Improved error display in the UI with colored snackbars
  - Added timeout detection and user-friendly messages

## Supported Fields

The edit item page now only shows and handles these fields (matching the API):

- ✅ **Name** - Product name
- ✅ **Price** - Product price (numeric)
- ✅ **Category** - Product category (dropdown)
- ✅ **Description** - Product description
- ✅ **Is Veg** - Vegetarian toggle
- ✅ **Timing Schedule** - Availability timing with timezone
- ✅ **Image** - Product image (existing/new)

## Removed Fields

These fields were removed as they're not supported by the API:

- ❌ **Food Type** - Not in API specification
- ❌ **Tags** - Not in API specification
- ❌ **Restaurant Food Type ID** - Not in API specification

## Network Improvements

1. **Timeout**: 30-second timeout on all requests
2. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for network errors (504, 502, 503, timeouts)
3. **Exponential Backoff**: 2-second delay for first retry, 4-second for second
4. **Error Detection**: Specific handling for different error types

## UI Improvements

1. **Better Loading States**: Clear indication when updating
2. **Validation Feedback**: Button disabled when form is invalid
3. **Error Messages**: Colored snackbars with specific error information
4. **Retry Information**: Shows when network issues are detected
5. **Success Feedback**: Green success message with auto-navigation

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Navigate to the edit item page
2. Fill in the required fields (name, price, category)
3. Try updating the item
4. Check that the request body matches the API specification
5. Verify that network errors are handled gracefully with retries

## Debug Information

The bloc now includes extensive debug logging:
- Request URL and body
- Response status and body
- Retry attempts
- Timing schedule serialization
- Network error details

Check the debug console for detailed information about API calls and errors.
