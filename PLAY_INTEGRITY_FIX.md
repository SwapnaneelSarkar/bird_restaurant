# Firebase Play Integrity API Issue - Complete Fix Guide

## Problem
You're getting an **"app-not-authorized"** error with the message:
```
This app is not authorized to use Firebase Authentication. Please verify that the correct package name, SHA-1, and SHA-256 are configured in the Firebase Console. [ Invalid app info in play_integrity_token ]
```

## Root Cause
The issue is that Firebase is trying to use **Play Integrity API** for phone authentication, but your debug build doesn't have the proper Play Store signing that Play Integrity API requires.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Play Integrity API Dependency
Added to `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
implementation 'com.google.android.play:integrity:1.3.0'
```

### 2. Created Build Configuration Utility
Created `lib/utils/build_config.dart` to intelligently handle different build types:
- **Debug builds**: Force reCAPTCHA flow to avoid Play Integrity issues
- **Release builds**: Let Firebase decide the best approach

### 3. Updated OTP Implementations
Modified all OTP implementations to use the build configuration:
- `lib/presentation/screens/otp_screen/bloc.dart`
- `lib/presentation/screens/delivery_partner_pages/otp/bloc.dart`
- `lib/presentation/screens/delivery_partners/view.dart`

## How It Works

### Debug Builds (Development)
- **Force reCAPTCHA flow**: `forceRecaptchaFlow: true`
- **Reason**: Avoids Play Integrity API which requires Play Store signing
- **Result**: reCAPTCHA will appear, but OTP will work

### Release Builds (Production)
- **Let Firebase decide**: `forceRecaptchaFlow: false`
- **Reason**: Play Integrity API works properly with Play Store signed apps
- **Result**: OTP should work without reCAPTCHA (if SHA fingerprints are correct)

## Testing

### 1. Clean and Rebuild
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 2. Test Scenarios
- **Debug build**: Should show reCAPTCHA but work
- **Release build**: Should work without reCAPTCHA (if SHA fingerprints are correct)

### 3. Expected Behavior
- **Debug builds**: reCAPTCHA appears, OTP works
- **Release builds**: No reCAPTCHA, OTP works directly

## Additional Steps for Production

### 1. Add Play Store SHA to Firebase
1. Go to Google Play Console → Setup → App signing
2. Copy the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint
3. Add it to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your Android app

### 2. Build Release APK
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### 3. Test Release Build
```bash
flutter install --release
```

## Troubleshooting

### If reCAPTCHA still appears in release builds:
1. **Check SHA fingerprints** in Firebase Console
2. **Verify Play Store SHA** is added correctly
3. **Wait 24-48 hours** for Firebase configuration to propagate
4. **Test with different devices** and network conditions

### If OTP still fails:
1. **Check Firebase Console** for error messages
2. **Verify Phone Authentication** is enabled in Firebase Console
3. **Check package name** matches exactly: `com.birdpartner.app`

## Important Notes

- **Debug builds will always show reCAPTCHA** - this is expected and normal
- **Release builds should work without reCAPTCHA** if properly configured
- **Play Integrity API** only works with Play Store signed apps
- **This is a security feature** by Google/Firebase, not a bug

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `android/app/build.gradle` - Added Play Integrity dependency
2. `lib/utils/build_config.dart` - New build configuration utility
3. `lib/presentation/screens/otp_screen/bloc.dart` - Updated Firebase settings
4. `lib/presentation/screens/delivery_partner_pages/otp/bloc.dart` - Updated Firebase settings
5. `lib/presentation/screens/delivery_partners/view.dart` - Updated Firebase settings

### Key Changes:
- Added intelligent build type detection
- Force reCAPTCHA for debug builds to avoid Play Integrity issues
- Let Firebase decide for release builds
- Improved error handling and logging

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current changes** with debug builds
2. **Add Play Store SHA** to Firebase Console
3. **Build and test release APK**
4. **Deploy to Play Store** for final testing

The solution ensures that:
- **Development works** (with reCAPTCHA)
- **Production works** (without reCAPTCHA, if properly configured)
- **Security is maintained** (Play Integrity API for production)
- **User experience is optimized** (minimal reCAPTCHA in production)
